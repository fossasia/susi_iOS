# Development Setup

Before you begin, you should already have the Xcode downloaded and set up correctly. You can find a guide on how to do this here: [Setting up Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Setup/Setup.html)

# Setting up the iOS Project

1. Download the _susi_iOS_ project source. You can do this either by forking and cloning the repository (recommended if you plan on pushing changes) or by downloading it as a ZIP file and extracting it.

2. Navigate to the unzipped folder and run `pod install`.

3. Open `Susi.xcworkspace` from the folder.

4. Build the project (⌘+B) and check for any errors.

5. Run the app (⌘+R).and test it.
