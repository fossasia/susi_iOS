    /// preceding session that modified the Realm by sucessfully committing a

    /// such histories (\ref hist_OutOfRealm) are placed outside the Realm file,

    /// new session is not obliged to use the same type of history (\ref
    /// hist_OutOfRealm). For this reason, and to achieve further backwards
    /// compatibility, the following rules are adopted:
    ///
    ///   - At the beginning of a new session, if there is no stored history
    ///     type (no top array), or if the stored history type is \ref
    ///     hist_None, assume that the history type used during the preceding
    ///     session was \ref hist_None or \ref hist_OutOfRealm, or that there
    ///     was no preceding session. In all other cases, assume that the stored
    ///     history type is the type used during the preceding session.
    ///
    ///   - When storing the history type, store \ref hist_None if the history
    ///     type used in the current session is \ref hist_None or \ref
    ///     hist_OutOfRealm. In all other cases, store the actual history type
    ///     used.
    ///
    /// It shall be allowed to switch to a \ref hist_InRealm history if the
    /// stored history type is either \ref hist_None or \ref
    /// hist_OutOfRealm. Fortunately, this can be done simply by adding a
    /// history to the Realm file (of type \ref hist_InRealm), and that is
    /// possible because a \ref hist_InRealm history is independent of any
    /// history used in a previous session (as long as it was session-confined),
    /// or whether any history was used at all. Conversely, if a \ref
    /// hist_OutOfRealm history was used in the previous session, then the
    /// contents of that history becomes obsolete at the end of the previous
    /// session.
    ///
    /// On the other hand, as soon as a history of type \ref hist_InRealm is
    /// added to a Realm file, that history type is binding for all subsequent
    /// sessions. In theory, this constraint is not necessary, and a later
    /// switch to \ref hist_None or \ref hist_OutOfRealm would be possible
    /// because of the fact that the contents of the history becomes obsolete at
    /// the end of the session, however, because the \ref hist_InRealm history
    /// remains in the Realm file, there are practical complications, and for
    /// that reason, such switching shall not be supported.
    ///
    /// The \ref hist_Sync history type can only be used if the stored history
    /// type is also \ref hist_Sync, or when there is no top array
    /// yet. Additionally, when the stored history type is \ref hist_Sync, then
    /// all subsequent sesssions must have the same type. These restrictions
    /// apply because such a history needs to be maintained persistently across
    /// sessions. That is, the contents of such a history is not obsolete at the
    /// end of the session, and is in general needed during subsequent sessions.
    ///
    /// In general, if there is no stored history type (no top array) at the
    /// beginning of a new session, or if the stored type disagrees with what is
    /// returned by get_history_type() (which is possible due to particular
    /// allowed changes of history type), the actual history type (as returned
    /// by get_history_type()) used during that session, must be stored in the
    /// Realm during the first successfully committed transaction of that
    /// session, if any are sucessfully committed. But note that there is still
    /// no need to expand the top array to store the history type \ref
    /// hist_None, due to the rule mentioned above.
    ///
    /// Due to the rules listed above, a new history type only actually needs to
    /// be stored when the history type of the session (get_history_type()) is
    /// neither \ref hist_None nor \ref hist_OutOfRealm, and only when that
